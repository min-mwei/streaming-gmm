# streaming GMM in Spark
This repository contains the code of my MSc dissertation project and is under development. 
It is an implementation of a Gaussian Mixtures Models algorithm in Spark that can work with streaming data. It uses
the results from [1] to implement a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for regularized GMMs.
